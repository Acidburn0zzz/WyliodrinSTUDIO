# Ideas

## Stand alone application

Wyliodrin STUDIO is a Chrome Application. That means that it currently runs on Chrome OS and any other system where Google Chrome is available.

Google has announced that it will retire Chrome Applications from other platforms than the Chromebook. While Chromebook users won't be affected, users using other systems will not be able to use Wyliodrin STUDIO.

A solution to this is to port Wyliodrin STUDIO as a stand alone application. There are two ways of duing this:

* [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)
* [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/)

There are ups and downs for each of the two, you can read a [comparison](http://tangiblejs.com/posts/nw-js-and-electron-compared-2016-edition) on tangiblejs.

### Knowledge required
* NodeJS (javascript)
* Grunt build tools

### Mentors
* [Razvan Serban](https://github.com/serban-razvan)
* [Alexandru Vochescu](https://github.com/valexandru)

## Update visual programming

Our visual programming helps firts timers to write an application in a visual way. More than dragging blocks, they can see the live python source. This is based on [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/).

We wrote several blocks for accessing sensors and peripherals. These are somehow outdated at the momment. Features that we would like to add are:

* improve UI (redesign of the toolbox)
* rethink some of the blocks
* rewrite some outdated blocks (facebook, etc)

### Knowledge required
* Javascript
* Familiar with blockly 
* Python (for writing the blocks generator)

### Mentor
* [Ioana Culic](https://github.com/ioanaculic)

## Improve Shell

Wyliodrin STUDIO uses [xterm.js](https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js). Features that should be implemented:
* scroll up and down
* select 
* copy and paste

The idea is to enhance xterm.js to have all those features.
