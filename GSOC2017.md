# Ideas

## Stand alone application

Wyliodrin STUDIO is a Chrome Application. That means that it currently runs on Chrome OS and any other system where Google Chrome is available.

Google has announced that it will retire Chrome Applications from other platforms than the Chromebook. While Chromebook users won't be affected, users using other systems will not be able to use Wyliodrin STUDIO.

A solution to this is to port Wyliodrin STUDIO as a stand alone application. There are two ways of duing this:

* [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)
* [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/)

There are ups and downs for each of the two, you can read a [comparison](http://tangiblejs.com/posts/nw-js-and-electron-compared-2016-edition) on tangiblejs.

The main idea is to be able to maintain the Chromebook version and the stand alone version in one code base. Based on the grunt command issued, it would build one or the other.

### Knowledge required
* NodeJS (javascript)
* Grunt build tools
* AngularJS

### Mentors
* [Razvan Serban](https://github.com/serban-razvan)
* [Alexandru Vochescu](https://github.com/valexandru)

## Update visual programming

Our visual programming helps first timers to write an application in a visual way. More than dragging blocks, they can see the live python source. This is based on [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/).

We wrote several blocks for accessing sensors and peripherals. These are somehow outdated at the momment. Another issue is that blocks are fixed, so users cannot add new blocks. We would like to add this feature.

Features that we would like to add are:

* improve UI (redesign of the toolbox)
* rethink some of the blocks
* rewrite some outdated blocks (facebook, etc)
* allow users to create new blocks

### Knowledge required
* Javascript
* Familiar with blockly 
* Python (for writing the blocks generator)

### Mentor
* [Ioana Culic](https://github.com/ioanaculic)

## Schematics Editor
Every project that users write in Wyliodrin STUDIO have the ability to load a schematics from [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/). This way if users share the projects, they contain all the information needed to be replicated.

Users need to download Fritzing, draw the schematics and than import it into Wyliodrin STUDIO. The idea is to allow users to directly draw the schemtics in Wyliodrin STUDIO. An example of how this should look like is [breadboard-circuits](https://github.com/cdog/breadboard-circuits). This imports the Fritzing components and allows users to place them in the schemtics.

### Knowledge needed
* Javascript
* D3.js (or similar)
* HTML

### Mentors
* [Ioana Culic](https://github.com/ioanaculic)
* [Razvan Serban](https://github.com/razvan-serban)


## Improve Dashboard

At the momment, the dashboard feature is pretty primitive. Graphs can be added one next to the other and can be rearranged only moving them left or right. Only time series or scalar values can be dispalyed.

The idea is to design and implement a new dashboard, the would allow:
* drag-n-drop of graphs
* multiple signals on the same graph
* display non-time series

### Mentors
* [Ioana Culic](https://github.com/ioanaculic)
* [Ovidiu Stoica](https://github.com/oviska)

### Knowledge required
* Javascript
  * [highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/)
* HTML
* CSS
* AngularJS

## Scientific graphs

The dashboard implies using the [libwyliodrin](https://github.com/wyliodrin/libwyliodrin)

What users need to do to display values on the dashboard is

```python
import wyliodrin

# get a value somehow

wyliodrin.sendSignal ('signal', value)
```

This will draw a point on the dashboard. There is no way to make some more complex cumputations and display them.

Python has the *pandas* and *numpy* libraries (and many more) that allow users to process data. The problem is that plotting is not possible as it needs to open a window (on the device, not on the user's computer).

The idea would be to write a *matplotlib* backend that instead of drawing the graph, to send an SVG to Wyliodrin STUDIO.

### Knowlegde needed
* Python
  * [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)
* Javascript (Ndoejs)
* AngularJS

## Write Tutorials
Wyliodrin STUDIO is designed with education in mind. When a users opens it the first time, he will ask the question "Now what?".

It is eally important for us to have solid set of getting started tutorials that users can use to start working with IoT.

A tutorial woild mean:
* writing a notebook with the steps that a user needs to take to be able to write the application;
* write the sample application
* draw the schematics of the hardware

### Knowledge needed
* Python
* Markdown
* Electrical Enineering (to build the device)

### Mentors
* [Alexandru Radovici](https://github.com/alexandruradovici)
* [Ioana Culic](https://github.com/ioanaculic)

## Improve Shell

Wyliodrin STUDIO uses [xterm.js](https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js). Features that should be implemented:
* scroll up and down
* select 
* copy and paste

The idea is to enhance xterm.js to have all those features.

## Document protocol

Document the protcol used to send and receive messages from the devices.
