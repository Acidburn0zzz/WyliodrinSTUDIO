# Ideas

## Stand alone application

Wyliodrin STUDIO is currently available as a Chrome Application. That means that it currently runs on Chrome OS and any other system where Google Chrome is available.

Google has announced that it will retire Chrome Applications from all the platforms other than the Chromebook. While Chromebook users won't be affected, users using other systems will not be able to use Wyliodrin STUDIO. The solution to this is to port Wyliodrin STUDIO as a stand alone application. There are two ways of doing this, out of which you can choose the prefered one:

* [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)
* [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/)

There are ups and downs for each of the two, tangiblejs makes a [comparison](http://tangiblejs.com/posts/nw-js-and-electron-compared-2016-edition) between the two.

Our final goal is to be able to maintain the Chromebook version and the stand alone version in one code base. Based on the grunt command issued, it would build one or the other.

### Knowledge required
* NodeJS (javascript)
* Grunt build tools
* AngularJS

### Mentors

* [Alexandru Vochescu](https://github.com/valexandru)

## Update visual programming

Visual programming is one of the programming langguages supported by Wyliodrin STUDIO. Visual programming helps first timers to write an application in a graphical way by dragging blocks (similar to Scratch). What is more, users can visualise the coresponding python source code as it gets generated on the fly. This whole visual environment is an implementation of Google [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/).

As part of implementing Blockly, we wrote several blocks for sensors and peripherals control and access. Some of these visual elements are currently outdated. In addition, we would like to add a new feature which would allow users to create the visual blocks they desire.

Features that we would like to add are:

* improve UI (redesign of the toolbox)
* rethink some of the blocks
* rewrite some outdated blocks (facebook, etc)
* allow users to create new blocks

### Knowledge required
* Javascript
* Familiarity with blockly 
* Python (for writing the blocks generator)

### Mentor
* [Ioana Culic](https://github.com/ioanaculic)

## Schematics Editor
Every project created using Wyliodrin STUDIO can have a [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) schematics attached to it. This way if a user shares a project to another one, the project will contain all the information needed to be replicated. For this, users need to download Fritzing, draw the schematics, export it as SVG and finally import it into Wyliodrin STUDIO. 

This project's idea is to allow users to draw the schematics directly in Wyliodrin STUDIO (an example of how this should look like [breadboard-circuits](https://github.com/cdog/breadboard-circuits) ). The implies importing the Fritzing components and allowing users to place them in the schematics.

### Knowledge needed
* Javascript
* D3.js (or similar)
* HTML

### Mentors
* [Ioana Culic](https://github.com/ioanaculic)
* [Razvan Serban](https://github.com/razvan-serban)


## Improve Dashboard

At the momment, the dashboard feature is pretty primitive. Graphs can be added one next to the other and can be rearranged only moving them left or right. Only time series or scalar values can be dispalyed.

The idea is to design and implement a new dashboard, the would allow:
* drag-n-drop of graphs
* multiple signals on the same graph
* display non-time series

### Mentors
* [Ioana Culic](https://github.com/ioanaculic)
* [Ovidiu Stoica](https://github.com/oviska)

### Knowledge required
* Javascript
  * [highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/)
* HTML
* CSS
* AngularJS

## Scientific graphs

The dashboard implies using the [libwyliodrin](https://github.com/wyliodrin/libwyliodrin)

What users need to do to display values on the dashboard is

```python
import wyliodrin

# get a value somehow

wyliodrin.sendSignal ('signal', value)
```

This will draw a point on the dashboard. There is no way to make some more complex cumputations and display them.

Python has the *pandas* and *numpy* libraries (and many more) that allow users to process data. The problem is that plotting is not possible as it needs to open a window (on the device, not on the user's computer).

The idea would be to write a *matplotlib* backend that instead of drawing the graph, to send an SVG to Wyliodrin STUDIO.

### Knowlegde needed
* Python
  * [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)
* Javascript (Ndoejs)
* AngularJS

## Write Tutorials
Wyliodrin STUDIO is designed with education in mind. When a users opens it the first time, he will ask the question "Now what?".

It is eally important for us to have solid set of getting started tutorials that users can use to start working with IoT.

A tutorial woild mean:
* writing a notebook with the steps that a user needs to take to be able to write the application;
* write the sample application
* draw the schematics of the hardware

### Knowledge needed
* Python
* Markdown
* Electrical Enineering (to build the device)

### Mentors
* [Alexandru Radovici](https://github.com/alexandruradovici)
* [Ioana Culic](https://github.com/ioanaculic)

## Improve Shell

Wyliodrin STUDIO uses [xterm.js](https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js). Features that should be implemented:
* scroll up and down
* select 
* copy and paste

The idea is to enhance xterm.js to have all those features.

## Document protocol

Document the protcol used to send and receive messages from the devices.
